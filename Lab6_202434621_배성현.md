# OpenSource SW Lab 6 

## 1. Version Control and Collaboration
Version control allows multiple people to work on a project by tracking changes over time. It manages source code history and facilitates collaboration by merging changes from different contributors.

## 2. Changes vs Snapshots
- **Change**: A modification to files.
- **Snapshot**: A record of the state of the project at a particular moment. Git stores snapshots rather than individual changes.

## 3. Types of Version Control
- **Local**: Tracks changes on a single machine.
- **Centralized**: One central server holds the main repository.
- **Distributed**: Every user has a full copy of the repository.

## 4. Installing Git
To install Git:
- Download it from the official website or use a package manager (e.g., `apt`, `brew`).

## 5. Git Configuration
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

## 6. Git Commands
 $ git init: Initialize a repository.
 $ git add: Stage changes.
 $ git commit: Save changes with a message.
 $ git status: Check the status of the repository.
 $ git log: View commit history.
 $ git push: Upload changes to a remote repository.
